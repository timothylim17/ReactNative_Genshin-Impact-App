const devNotes = {
  Amber:
    "Said to be the worst character in the game currently because of her Elemental Skill scaling is not what it should be. She is supposed to be a damage dealer, but has HP scaling. Other than that, she is versatile because she is the only Pyro archer in the game and Pyro is really strong.",
  Barbara:
    "Amazing healer given to us early in the game. After using Elemental Skill, her attacks will heal EVERYONE in the party. It is recommended that you keep 1 healer in your party to save yourself from having to keep eating food.",
  Beidou:
    "Terribly underrated character. One of my (Tim's) favorite characters. Her Elemental Skill has a countering mechanic, which, if done correctly, can completely negate damage and do a lot of damage. Her Elemental Burst summons an Electro aura around her and her attacks will also do Electro damage.",
  Bennett:
    "One of the best supports in the game. He is able to act as a healer and give your party an attack buff.",
  Chongyun:
    "With his Elemental Skill, he is able to turn anyone’s auto attack into Cryo damage as well as increase their attack speed. While the increase in attack speed is very rare and valuable, turning the attacks of the character into Cryo may actually hinder your characters damage (i.e. Razor).",
  Diluc:
    "Pyro is broken. One of the best damage dealers in the game. One of my partner’s (Cy) favorite character. His Elemental Skill is a three-part combo of Pyro damage that he does while spinning and he summons a gigantic phoenix with his Elemental Burst. After his Elemental Burst, his Claymore is imbued with Pyro. One of the only characters that pair up amazingly with Chongyun.",
  Diona:
    "Amazing unit. She is an archer, a Cryo, and a healer. She fills so many requisites in a team alone. Her Elemental Skill gives a Cryo shield and her Elemental Burst summons an area of Cryo, which heals who stands on it.",
  Fischl:
    "Electro archer who can be used as a dps or support. Her Elemental Skill summons her Electro bird, which is like a turret. Her Elemental Burst summons her bird like before, but only after she becomes the bird and deals damage to anyone she runs into.",
  Jean:
    "Anemo healer. Her Elemental Skill gathers wind on the tip of her sword and is able to launch small enemies. Her Elemental Burst summons an area of healing around her.",
  Kaeya:
    "Free Cryo character given in the beginning of the game. His cooldown for his Elemental Skill are really low, which is why he is a viable Cryo support. He launches icicles in front of him with his Elemental Skill and summons three Cryo swords around him with his Elemental Burst.",
  Keqing:
    "Electro swordswoman. One of my (Tim’s) favorite characters. With her Elemental Skill, she puts an Electro point, which she can burst or teleport to. With her Elemental Burst, in a circle around her, she will deal a consecutive amount of Electro slashes, finalizing with a finishing slash.",
  Klee:
    "Pyro is broken. One of, if not, the best damage dealers in the game. She throws bombs and the bombs do a lot of damage. Her gameplay may seem boring, but if used correctly, can be very interesting.",
  Lisa:
    "Free Electro character given in the beginning. Although she is not a terrible character, her utility is not as useful as others to be a viable support and her damage is not as good as others to be a viable dps.",
  Mona:
    "S-Tier bod- I mean, S-Tier dps support… *Cough* Her Elemental Skill is able to taunt enemies and do a lot of damage. On top of that, her Elemental Burst puts a mark on the enemy, and when taken damage, the mark will pop and do a lot of damage.",
  Ningguang:
    "Very good damage dealer. One of my partner’s (Cy) favorite character. Her Elemental Skill can be used to block projectiles and buff her damage and her Elemental Burst is basically an assault rifle of rocks.",
  Noelle:
    "A maid that swings a claymore around and heals your party. She is given to us for free on the beginner banner and can be used as a dps if you want.",
  Qiqi:
    "THE best healer in the game. Her Elemental Skill will periodically give your character a generous heal, and if Qiqi attacks with it activated, will heal the entire party. Her Elemental Burst, puts marks on the enemy and whoever attack that enemy, will heal a lot. At Ascension 4, she has a chance to put that mark with just her normal attacks every 30 seconds.",
  Razor:
    "Amazing Dps unit, even though he is only a 4 star. He is a selfish character, meaning that he will only be useful if you have him out and attacking the enemy. By tapping his Elemental Skill, he will do a quick Electro swipe and generate an orb. By holding his Elemental Skill, he will consume that orb and recharge his Elemental Burst. His Elemental Burst summons an Electo ghost wolf, which attacks with him, and increases his attack speed",
  Sucrose:
    "Rare Anemo character that gathers enemies together. Her Elemental Skill does a single burst which pulls enemies to the center of it. Her Elemental Burst knocks enemies up for an amount of time and get any element near it.",
  Tartaglia:
    "Also known as Childe, is one of the best AOE damage dealers. The only character that switches weapons. He is a bow user but, with his Elemental Skill, he switches to melee with two Hydro daggers. His Elemental Burst (Bow) does a damage in a circle in front of him, his Elemental Burst (Melee) slashed all the enemies in front of him.",
  Venti:
    "S-Tier support. He is able to gather all enemies together with his Elemental Burst for a very long time.",
  Xiangling:
    "Free character given after beating a certain part of the game and an amazing dps support. She is able to put a teddy bear in front of her that occasionally spits fire with her Elemental Skill and summons a wheel of fire around her with her Elemental Burst.",
  Xingqiu:
    "One of the best supports in the game. He does two slashes of Hydro to the enemy with his Elemental Skill, but he is amazing because of his Elemental Burst. His Elemental Burst throws Hydro swords to the enemy anytime someone attacks.",
  Xinyan:
    "Can be an amazing support. Her Elemental Skill generates a Pyro shield, and gives the character with the shield additional damage. Her Elemental Burst summons a burst of flames around her.",
  Zhongli:
    "He can but should not be used as a dps. He is an amazing crowd controller and can dish out a substantial amount of damage if used correctly. By tapping his Elemental Skill, he summons a pillar which will consistently burst and do damage. By holding his Elemental Skill, he creates a shield on himself and does damage to enemies. His Elemental Burst summons a meteor which petrifies any enemy hit by it.",
